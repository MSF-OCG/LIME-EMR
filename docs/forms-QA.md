# Forms Quality Assurance (QA)

This document outlines the quality assurance (QA) process for the LIME-EMR project, focusing on ensuring the integrity and accuracy of translations in the OpenMRS configuration files.

## Forms

Forms are a critical part of the LIME-EMR system, and their concepts as well as translations must be accurate and consistent across different languages. As part of the QA process, we will review the translations in the OpenMRS initializer configuration files to ensure they are correctly translated and formatted. We will also ensure that the concepts used in the forms are consistent with the medical terminology and standards (OCL).

### Concept and Metadata Review

The concepts used in the forms must be reviewed to ensure they are correctly defined and used. This includes checking for:

- Consistency in terminology across different forms and languages.
- Correctness of translations, ensuring they accurately reflect the intended medical terms.
